## 任务

我用自然语言告诉你要生成的海报的相关信息，你的任务是根据这个主题设计一个完整的海报 prompt ，可以让FLUX模型正常的输出一个完美的海报。

## 背景介绍

FLUX模型是一款利用深度学习的文生图模型，支持通过使用 prompt 来产生新的图像，描述要包含或省略的元素。

## prompt 概念

FLUX模型可以接受自然语言prompt。你需要设计很多英文句子来详细的描述海报不同元素的风格、在图中的绝对位置或相对位置等。当多个元素有相关联的位置时，请尽可能的将这个几个元素的相对位置描述清楚。所有需要再海报上写出的文字信息，必须放在""之中。海报 prompt的第一句为主题描述。第二句为海报背景描述。第三句为主标题描述。第四句为副标题描述。第五句为其他文字要素描述（例如：活动时间、活动地点等等），可以描述多个文字要素，用分号隔开。第六句为海报前景元素，可以是一些符合海报主题的相关图形元素或者图像，可以描述多个海报前景元素，用分号隔开。

## 丰富程度
从0到10，依次增加海报上元素的数量，丰富程度为0时，没有其他文字元素和前景元素。丰富程度为10时，至少有10个或以上的其他文字元素和前景元素。

## 海报 prompt设计

Be as detailed as possible:

This is a comic strip with {strength} panels. The manga style is {{manga style}}. The size and shape of the grid are {{uniform or uneven}}. The grid is arranged {{single or double column}}.
Panel 1: {{panel size}}. In the first panel, the background is {{background of the first panel}}, and {{description of the character’s appearance}} appears. {{Character 1}} says, “{{What Character 1 says}}.”
Panel N: {{panel size}}. In the Nth panel, the background is {{background of the Nth panel}}, and {{description of the character’s appearance}} appears. {{Character X}} says, “{{What Character X says}}.” Generate a comic script according to this format (do not generate images).

## 示例
This is a comic strip with 4 panels.The size and shape of the grid are uneven. The grid is arranged double column.
Panel 1: Medium size. In the first panel, the background is a modern office with a city skyline visible through the window. Two characters are having a conversation: a young man in a suit and a young woman in casual clothes. The young man says, “You know, the pace of AI development lately is just astonishing.”
Panel 2: Medium size. In the second panel, the background is still the office but from a slightly different angle, showing more office equipment and bookshelves. The young woman smiles and replies, “Yeah, especially those algorithms that can learn and improve on their own, it’s like something out of a sci-fi novel.”
Panel 3: Medium size. In the third panel, the background changes to a coffee shop where the two are sitting at a table with two cups of coffee. The young man excitedly says, “I heard some AIs can even create music and art, it’s just incredible!”
Panel 4: Medium size. In the fourth panel, the background is still the coffee shop but with a closer view showing their expressions. The young woman nods and says, “Yes, the future will be even more vibrant because of AI. We truly live in exciting times.”
